## Infrastructure

### Self-Hosted Build Runners

To ensure optimal build performance and reliability, this project utilizes self-hosted GitHub Actions runners:

| Runner Name         | Architecture | CPU               | RAM   | Storage      | Network  | Location |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------|--------------|----------|----------|
| **netcup-de-arm64** | ARM64        | 10-vCore @ 3.0GHz | 16 GB | 1024 GB NVMe | 2.5 Gbps | Germany  |

Each runner is professionally managed and optimized for CI/CD workloads. If you're interested in contributing hardware resources, please open an issue to discuss integration.

**Special thanks** to all supporters who have donated computing resources to this project.
